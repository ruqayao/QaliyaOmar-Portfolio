# QaliyaOmar-Portfolio
My name is Qaliya Omar, and I am majoring in Biomedical Informatics, specializing in Bioinformatics at Indiana University Indianapolis. I have also already recently completed my Associate's degree in Data Analytics at Ivy Tech Community College. I have grown a large interest in this field over the course of my academic journey and I believe I could be well suited for this occupation. Data Analytics essentially involves analyzing large amounts of data in order to extract meaningful insights that could later be potentially utilized to benefit businesses. It requires a great understanding of statistical analytics and computer programming which are both topics that I enjoy researching and learning more about. My strengths typically lie within web development specifically front-end work although I am looking to expand my knowledge on Python as well as other programming languages. A final project that I completed for a class had required me to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application using Python. I had chosen to create an order form that could be used to buy items at a bakery. The order form would display a menu of the items available for purchase and calculate the total price of the order based on the amount that is input into the form. The project is currently uploaded on Git Hub for public viewing and I have attached a link to the Git Hub repository here: https://github.com/ruqayao/SweetCakes. I also worked on a different group project for one of my software development classes where we had decided to create a Personal Finance Tracker, a web app built with Django that allows users to: 

- Log income and expenses by date, category, and amount. 
- See charts (e.g., a pie chart/bar graph) using Chart.js 
- Predict future income and expenses based on past trends. 
- Provide a basic API to retrieve financial data based on past trends.
