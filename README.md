# QaliyaOmar-Portfolio
My name is Qaliya Omar, and I am majoring in Data Analytics at Ivy Tech Community College. I plan to transfer to a 4-year university to continue my studies and earn a bachelors degree in Data Science. I have grown a large interest in this field over the course of my academic journey and I believe I could be well suited for this occupation. Data Science essentially involves analyzing large amounts of data in order to extract meaningful insights that could later be potentially utilized to benefit businesses. It requires a great understanding of statistical analytics and computer programming which are both topics that I enjoy researching and learning more about. My strengths typically lie within web development specifically front-end work although I am looking to expand my knowledge on Python as well as other programming languages.
